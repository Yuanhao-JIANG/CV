\section{Research Experience}
\cventry{Summer 2024}{Summer Research Student}{The University of Edinburgh}{}{}{
  Applied constrained SDEs in score-based diffusion models to restrict the data points on Riemannian manifolds, potentially allowing more structural and controllable data perturbation and data generation.
}
\cventry{Summer 2023}{Summer Research Student}{The University of Edinburgh}{}{}{
  Applied innovative approaches, especially the Leimkuhler-Matthews discretization method, for solving SDEs in diffusion generative models, to both the perturbation and denoising process. Compared sample quality and training efficiency with traditional numerical SDE solvers including the Euler-Maruyama method, the Milstein method, the stochastic Runge-Kutta method and so on. Embedded the diffusion coefficient function in perturbation SDE with spatial information to allow potentially higher perturbation flexibility.
}
\cventry{Summer 2022}{Summer Research Student}{The University of Edinburgh}{}{}{
  Constructed interactive environment to model specific quantitative finance scenario. Implemented various model-free algorithms, including Actor-Critic, REINFORCE, and PPO, to train our pricing policy. Compared different algorithms for training efficiency and effectiveness.
